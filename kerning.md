## Notes on Syllabics Kerning
Within this repository you will find a .csv document that provides Syllabics kerning pairs and suggested classes for implementing into Syllabics typefaces. Within the context of Syllabics typography, kerning has very rarely, if ever, been implemented, although it's effect is quite dramatic on the legibility and readability of Syllabics texts across all user communities. The kerning pairs and classes are suggested, and kerning tables for a given Syllabics font implementation should take into consideration the direct requirements of each specific community and their language patterns.

A kerning data set has been provided in this repository that contains pairs and classes required for kerning Syllabics.
