# Dene Syllabics

## ᑕᓀᖚ ᖚᗀᐥ  (Dane-zaa ZáágeɁ) (Beaver)
The Dane-zaa ZáágeɁ Syllabics (formerly known as the Beaver Syllabics) were once in common use within the community in the mid-to-late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Syllabics are not commonly used – if at all – within this community today, with the community using a standardized roman orthography today. The Dane-zaa ZáágeɁ Syllabics were part of the larger pattern of Dene Syllabics, which follows the Square Form style of Syllabics, affecting the proportion, width, and appearance of glyphs such as ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᑲ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ.

❶ As mentioned above, the following glyphs – in order to be localized to the Dene Syllabics which the Dane-zaa ZáágeɁ Syllabics are a part of – must be rendered in the Square Form style: ᗃ ᗀ ᗁ ᗂ ᒪ ᒣ ᒥ ᒧ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᑲ ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ ᓴ ᓭ ᓯ ᓱ ᒐ ᒉ ᒋ ᒍ ᘔ ᘛ ᘚ ᘕ ᔭ ᔦ ᔨ ᔪ. This can be achieved by various means, either mapping these glyphs via an OpenType Layout feature, or, providing a customized build specific to this community, representating these glyphs in the Square Form style by default.

## ᓴᔨᓯ ᑌᓀ (Saı́yısı́ dëne) (Sayisi Dene)
The Sayisi Dene Syllabics are [actively used within the community today](http://skfn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sayisi-Dene-First-Nation.pdf), and follow the typographic pattern of the Dene Syllabics in it's use of the Square Form Syllabics style, which affects the following glyphs: ᗃ ᗀ ᗁ ᗂ ᣬ ᑲ ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᑰ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ ᣡ ᒪ ᒣ ᒥ ᒧ ᒨ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᓅ ᓴ ᓭ ᓯ ᓱ ᓲ ᒐ ᒉ ᒋ ᒍ ᒎ ᘔ ᘛ ᘚ ᘕ ᣱ ᔭ ᔦ ᔨ ᔪ ᔮ. As these characters are shared with other Syllabics-using communities, these glyphs can be accommodated by providing a customized build specifically for Sayisi Dene, or, by mapping these glyphs with an OpenType Layout feature. Additionally, inline with many other languages that use the Dene Syllabics, Sayisi Dene requires multiple vertical positions of finals glyphs to mark consonant inflections, with Sayisi Dene using two vertical positions for finals glyphs: mid line and baseline. Note that no finals glyphs sit at the top line in Sayisi Dene Syllabics.

> Note that the glyph sequences such as ᐤᐊ and ᐤᐆ in the above chart are not singularly-encoded, composite glyphs encoded in Unicode such as were described in the Cree and Ojibway sections (ᐎ ᐄ ᐐ), but rather, are inline glyph sequences. All of the Dene Syllabics orthographies to follow feature these sequences, and all are encoded as inline sequences.

❶ The finals glyphs `- ᕁ ᐤ ᐧ` should be vertically positioned at the mid line, centered between the top and baselines.

❷ The finals glyphs `ᑊ ᐠ ᐟ ᒼ ᐣ ᐢ ᒡ ᒢ ᐡ` should be vertically positioned at the baseline.

## ᑌᓀ ᓱᒼᕄᓀ ᔭᕠᐁ (Dënësųłinë́) (Chipewyan)
the Chipewyan language community once used Syllabics as it's primary writing system, from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century, however, contemporary communities largely use a roman orthography that is similar to the writing systems of other Athabaskan Dene communities in North America. The Chipewyan Syllabics are rooted in the pattern of Dene Syllabics, which features the syllabics glyphs `ᑲ ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ ᒪ ᒣ ᒥ ᒧ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᒐ ᒉ ᒋ ᒍ ᖍ ᖊ ᖋ ᖌ ᓴ ᓭ ᓯ ᓱ ᔭ ᔦ ᔨ ᔪ ᘔ ᘚ ᘛ ᘕ` represented in the Square Form style. Additionally, finals glyphs that vary in their vertical positioning, between top and middle positions.

❶ The finals glyphs `ᑦ ᐢ` should be vertically positioned at the top line.

❷ The finals glyphs `ᐤ ᑊ ᐟ ᐠ ᔆ ᑦ ᙆ ᒼ ᐣ ᕀ ᑋ -` should be vertically positioned at the mid line, centered between the top and baselines.

❸ Note that Chipewyan uses two graphically-identical characters in it's orthography: U+1466 ᑦ CANADIAN  SYLLABICS T and U+14BC ᒼ CANADIAN SYLLABICS WEST-CREE M. U+1466 is intended to represent the top line "gh" final consonant, while U+14BC represents the mid line position "m" final. Both characters should be present within Chipewyan Syllabics typefaces to support the input method used by the community.

## ᓴᑋᕲᖌᑎᑊᐠᓀᐠ ᔭᕱ (Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́) (North Slavey)
North Slavey Syllabics were once the primary means of writing the language throughout the mid-to-late 19th and early 20th centuries, although today, a standardized roman orthography is the most common primary writing system for this language community. The North Slavey Syllabics follow the pattern of the Dene Syllabics, with the glyphs ᑲ ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ ᒪ ᒣ ᒥ ᒧ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᖍ ᖊ ᖋ ᖌ ᓴ ᓭ ᓯ ᓱ ᔭ ᔦ ᔨ ᔪ ᘔ ᘚ ᘛ ᘕ ᗴ ᗯ ᗰ ᗱ ᒐ ᒉ ᒋ ᒍ being represented in the Square Form style, and finals glyphs varying vertical positioning.

## ᑌᓀ ᒐ (Dene Zhatıé) (South Slavey)
Dene Zhatıé (South Slavey) Syllabics were – as for the North Slavey, Chipewyan, and Sayisi Dene communities – the primary means of writing the language from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century. While a standardized roman orthography is the primary writing system today, the Syllabics still see some use in educational settings. The Dene Zhatıé (South Slavey) Syllabics follow the conventions of the Dene Syllabics, in which the glyphs `ᗃ ᗀ ᗁ ᗂ ᣬ ᑲ ᑫ ᑭ ᑯ ᑰ ᕍ ᕃ ᕄ ᕊ ᣡ ᒪ ᒣ ᒥ ᒧ ᒨ ᓇ ᓀ ᓂ ᓄ ᓅ ᓴ ᓭ ᓯ ᓱ ᓲ ᒐ ᒉ ᒋ ᒍ ᒎ ᘔ ᘛ ᘚ ᘕ ᣱ ᔭ ᔦ ᔨ ᔪ ᔫ` are rendered in the Square Form style. Dene Zhatıé is also unique in that it's Syllabics orthography requires three vertical finals positions: top, mid, and baseline.

❶ The finals glyphs `ᑉ ᐨ ᑊ ᐠ ᒼ ᐡ ᒡ ᐦ ʼ` should be vertically positioned at the top line.

❷ The finals glyphs `ᕀ ᐢ ᐣ ᐟ` should be vertically positioned at the mid line, centered between the top and baselines.

❸ The finals glyph `ᒢ` should be vertically positioned at the baseline.

❹ Note that Dene Zhatıé (South Slavey) Syllabics uses the character U+02BC ʼ MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE to mark the glottal stop in it's Syllabics orthography.
