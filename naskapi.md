# ᐃᔪᐤ ᐃᔨᒧᐅᓐ / Iyuw Iyimuun (Naskapi)
The Naskapi language is part of the Cree language dialect continuum, and as such, Naskapi communities have a strong use of Syllabics, and it is their preferred means of writing their language. The Naskapi Syllabics follow the Eastern Cree Syllabics conventions in the form of the finals characters, as well as the Round form style. It diverges in orthographic requirements due to additional sounds present in Naskapi that are not found in Eastern James Bay Cree, such as "wa" and "scwaa" sounds. The graphic representation of these sounds result in unique characters that only Naskapi uses, in particular: ᐛ ᑈ ᑥ ᒂ ᒠ ᒺ ᓏ ᔄ ᔽ ᔋᐸ ᔍ ᔎ ᔏ ᔋ

❶ Note the expected representation of U+150C ᔌ CANADIAN SYLLABICS NASKAPI SPWA, which should feature the "scwa" modifier glyph nested on top of the base "pa" (ᐸ) character. Local readers in the community expect this shape, and this glyph should be represented as an inline sequence of U+150B ᔋ CANADIAN SYLLABICS NASKAPI S-W + U+1438 ᐸ CANADIAN SYLLABICS PA. 

❷ the narrow no break space is required for indicating a preverb in Naskapi, and should be about a third of the width of the wide Syllabics space glyph:
