# Syllabics Knowledge
The purpose of this repository is to provide resources to those interested in developing Canadian Syllabics typefaces for the various Indigneous communities in North America that use this writing system. In this repo, you will find 

## Syllabics typographic guidelines and local typographic preferences
The following article is a good resource towards understanding a wider scope of the Syllabics in regards to the general principles and typographic concepts inherent to the writing system, as well as historical and contemporary context towards local typographic preferences and orthographic needs as they vary across the many First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada that use this script. It is also a useful article for understanding how to look at the UCAS(Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics) encoding range in Unicode, and its glyph representations. For a better understanding of how to segment UCAS and view the Syllabics within their seaparate typographic traditions, please see section two:
https://www.typotheque.com/articles/syllabics_typographic_guidelines

In order to work on font development for the Canadian Syllabics, it is important to become acquainted with the behaviours and concepts that are inherently unique to this writing system. The above article has been prepared to outline these concepts that are unique to the Syllabics, and is a good starting point towards understanding the terminology and concepts provided within these development materials.

The following sections provide an overview of the local typographic preferences and orthographic requirements for each individual Indigenous language community that uses the Syllabics, with the purpose of typeface design and development in mind. For each community, their local Syllabics preferences have been presented graphically in the form of their Syllabics orthography chart, accompanied by footnotes were necessary beneath the chart. 

Below these charts is a subset of the required glyph set for each community. In these subsets, please note that the glyph representations will in some cases differ from the graphical representation in the orthography charts above. This is expected, as UCAS harmonizes many of the Syllabics orthographies into one unified set, although a much greater diversity of glyph representations exists within the scope of Syllabics communities. These subsets are useful for developing typefaces for specific Indigenous language communities, where one may not need to cover the entire UCAS encoding range, which is quite large.

Furthermore, each section contains any relevant notes that may be applicable towards accommodating specific local typographic preferences and variations, or issues surrounding encoding.

## ᐊᓂᐦᔑᓈᐯᒧᐎᓐ / Anishinaabemowin (Ojibway)
Although all Ojibway language communities could use Syllabics to accurately represent their languages, it is important to note that not all Ojibway communtiies use Syllabics. It is particularly the communities of northern Ontario and western Ojibway dialect speakers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan that have a current use of Syllabics. All other communities use a number of roman orthography systems to write their local dialects, including Algonquin, Odawa, Eastern Ojibwe, and Central Ojibwe. There is a relatively high degree of variation in the local typographic and orthographic preferences for Ojibway Syllabics between communities, particularly for communities in northern Ontario. This is particularly evident in northern Ontario communities, and can be seen primarily in the form and orientation of finals characters and their vertical positioning. The following chart shows the preferred representation of the Ojibway Syllabics orthography:

**[1]** This is notably the difference between the i-pos and a-pos finals glyphs.

**[2]** centered ᓐ for Rice Lake communities.

###### notes on local encoding practices
**[3]** discuss the w-dot encoding here, sometimes it is middle dot cans (ᐧ) (ᐧ + ᐃ = ᐧᐃ), and sometimes it is the composite glyph (ᐎ). This would also potentially repeat for Cree communities as well.
