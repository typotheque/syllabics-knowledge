# Syllabics Knowledge
The purpose of this repository is to provide resources to those interested in developing Canadian Syllabics typefaces for the various Indigneous communities in North America that use this writing system.

## ðŸ“– [Syllabics typographic guidelines and local typographic preferences](https://www.typotheque.com/articles/syllabics_typographic_guidelines)

In order to work on font development for the Canadian Syllabics, it is important to become acquainted with the behaviours and concepts that are inherently unique to this writing system. The above article has been prepared to outline these concepts that are unique to the Syllabics, and is a good starting point towards understanding the terminology and concepts provided within these development materials. It is also a useful article for understanding how to look at the encoding of the Syllabics in the Unicode Standard ("UCAS", Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics), to understand how Unicode encodes and represents the Syllabics, how this differs from various local Syllabics-using Indigenous communities. This helps to provide context for necessary solutions that may be required in Syllabics font development for providing support for local typographic variations within specific communities. 

For a better understanding of how to view the Syllabics within their seaparate typographic traditions and local typographic and encoding preferences, [please see section two]

## Recommendations for Syllabics typeface development

The following sections provide an overview of the local typographic preferences and orthographic requirements for each individual Indigenous language community that uses the Syllabics, with the purpose of typeface design and development in mind. For each community, their local Syllabics preferences have been presented graphically in the form of their Syllabics orthography chart, accompanied by footnotes were necessary beneath the chart. 

Below these charts is a subset of the required glyph set for each community. In these subsets, please note that the glyph representations will in some cases differ from the graphical representation in the orthography charts above. This is expected, as UCAS harmonizes many of the Syllabics orthographies into one unified set, although a much greater diversity of glyph representations exists within the scope of Syllabics communities. These subsets are useful for developing typefaces for specific Indigenous language communities, where one may not need to cover the entire UCAS encoding range, which is quite large.

Furthermore, each section contains any relevant notes that may be applicable towards accommodating specific local typographic preferences and variations, or issues surrounding encoding preferences for each community, and suggestions towards implementation in a given Syllabics typeface.
