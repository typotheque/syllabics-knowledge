# Syllabics Knowledge
open source knowledge for the Canadian Syllabics writing system. The purpose of this repository is to provide resources to those interested in developing Canadian Syllabics typefaces for the various Indigneous communities in North America that use this writing system.

## Syllabics typographic guidelines and local typographic preferences
https://www.typotheque.com/articles/syllabics_typographic_guidelines

In order to work on font development for the Canadian Syllabics, it is important to become acquainted with the behaviours and concepts that are inherently unique to this writing system. The above article has been prepared to outline these concepts that are unique to the Syllabics, and is a good starting point towards understanding the terminology and concepts provided within these development materials.

## ᐊᓂᐦᔑᓈᐯᒧᐎᣙ / Anishinaabemowin (Ojibway)
There is a great deal of variation in Ojibway Syllabics, and this persists to perhaps an even higher or similar degree in the roman orthographies within this language community. Although all Ojibway language communities could use Syllabics to accurately represent their languages, it is important to note that not all Ojibway communtiies use Syllabics. It is particularly the communities of northern Ontario and western Ojibway dialect speakers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan that have a current use of Syllabics. All other communities use a number of roman orthography systems to write their local dialects, including Algonquin, Odawa, Eastern Ojibwe, and Central Ojibwe. The following chart shows the preferred representation of the Ojibway Syllabics orthography:

###### local typographic variation
Note that there is a high degree of variability in locally-preferred typographic forms in Ojibway communities that use Syllabics. This is particularly evident in northern Ontario communities, and can be seen primarily in the orientation of finals characters and their vertical positioning. 

>> This is notably the difference between the i-pos and a-pos finals glyphs.

>> centered ᓐ for Rice Lake communities.

###### notes on local encoding practices
>> discuss the w-dot encoding here, sometimes it is middle dot cans (ᐧ) (ᐧ + ᐃ = ᐧᐃ), and sometimes it is the composite glyph (ᐎ).
