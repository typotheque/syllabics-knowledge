# Syllabics Knowledge
The purpose of this repository is to provide resources to those interested in developing Canadian Syllabics typefaces for the various Indigneous communities in North America that use this writing system. In this repo, you will find 

## Syllabics typographic guidelines and local typographic preferences
The following article is a good resource towards understanding a wider scope of the Syllabics in regards to the general principles and typographic concepts inherent to the writing system, as well as historical and contemporary context towards local typographic preferences and orthographic needs as they vary across the many First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada that use this script. It is also a useful article for understanding how to look at the `UCAS` (Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics) encoding range in Unicode, to understand how Unicode encodes and represents the Syllabics, and how this differs from various local Syllabics-using Indigenous communities. For a better understanding of how to view the Syllabics within their seaparate typographic traditions, please see section two:
https://www.typotheque.com/articles/syllabics_typographic_guidelines

In order to work on font development for the Canadian Syllabics, it is important to become acquainted with the behaviours and concepts that are inherently unique to this writing system. The above article has been prepared to outline these concepts that are unique to the Syllabics, and is a good starting point towards understanding the terminology and concepts provided within these development materials.

The following sections provide an overview of the local typographic preferences and orthographic requirements for each individual Indigenous language community that uses the Syllabics, with the purpose of typeface design and development in mind. For each community, their local Syllabics preferences have been presented graphically in the form of their Syllabics orthography chart, accompanied by footnotes were necessary beneath the chart. 

Below these charts is a subset of the required glyph set for each community. In these subsets, please note that the glyph representations will in some cases differ from the graphical representation in the orthography charts above. This is expected, as UCAS harmonizes many of the Syllabics orthographies into one unified set, although a much greater diversity of glyph representations exists within the scope of Syllabics communities. These subsets are useful for developing typefaces for specific Indigenous language communities, where one may not need to cover the entire UCAS encoding range, which is quite large.

Furthermore, each section contains any relevant notes that may be applicable towards accommodating specific local typographic preferences and variations, or issues surrounding encoding.

## ᐊᓂᐦᔑᓈᐯᒧᐎᓐ / Anishinaabemowin (Ojibway)
Although all Ojibway language communities could use Syllabics to accurately represent their languages, it is important to note that not all Ojibway communtiies use Syllabics. It is particularly the communities of northern Ontario and western Ojibway dialect speakers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan that have a current use of Syllabics. All other communities use a number of roman orthography systems to write their local dialects, including Algonquin, Odawa, Eastern Ojibwe, and Central Ojibwe. There is a relatively high degree of variation in the local typographic and orthographic preferences for Ojibway Syllabics between communities, particularly for communities in northern Ontario. This is particularly evident in northern Ontario communities, and can be seen primarily in the form and orientation of finals characters and their vertical positioning. The following chart shows the preferred representation of the Ojibway Syllabics orthography:


![Ojibway-Syllabics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17300547/202013295-f4992272-59d2-4a4a-a81d-bb4fdf716f6c.png)


> ❶ A major distinction towards local typographic preferences amongst Northern Ontario Ojibwe communities is in the preferred form or orientation of finals characters. This is notably the difference between Western and Eastern Cree finals forms, and the i-pos and a-pos orientation scheme of finals glyphs. This can vary between communities, and between users within the same community. Some northern Ontario Ojibwe communities may follow the form of the Western Cree finals shapes, while others the Eastern Cree. For those who use the Eastern Cree finals forms, they may follow either the `a vowel` position or `i vowel` position orientation, a convention unique to Ontario Ojibwe Syllabics. There can also be mixing of these two orientation positions within the same text. Unicode encodes both the `a` and `i` position finals orientations to accommodate these preferences.

> ② Note that there is a local preference for a horizontally-centered n final `ᓐ` for some Northwestern Ojibwe communities.

> ❸ There is variation in the preferred positioning of the w-dot in relation to the syllabic that it is modifying. Traditionally, Western Cree and Ojibwe communities place the w-dot to the right of the base syllabic, while Eastern Cree and Ojibwe communities will place the dot to the left of the syllabic, to lead the base character it is modifying. There is variation within 

There is also variation in how this dot is encoded in texts between communities and individual users within communities. Some users will encode the `w dot` as two distinct code points: `U+1427 FINAL MIDDLE DOT (ᐧ)` plus the base syllabic glyph (`ᐧ` + `ᐃ` = `ᐧᐃ`). Others will encode these sequences of `w dot` with the pre-composed base glyphs within UCAS, where `w dot` and the base syllabic are treated as a composite glyph (`ᐎ`, `ᐗ`).
